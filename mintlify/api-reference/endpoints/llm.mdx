# Single-Agent LLM Integration

For testing and introductory educational purposes, we integrate with multiple language models (LLMs) to provide chat completion via simple `post /api/core/{provider}/chat/completions` endpoints.

# Multi-Agent LLM Integration

The Multi-Agent robotics endpoint (accessed via `post /api/core/agent`) accepts fused data and routes them to a collaborative multi-agent system, providing a powerful way to solve more complex robotics tasks. For more information, see [developing/llms](../../developing/5_llms).

## cURL commands

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.openmind.org/api/core/openrouter/chat/completions' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_KEY>' \
--data '{
    "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-4.1",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Hello, how are you?"
        }
    ]
}'
```

Replace **YOUR_KEY** with your api-key from the [portal](https://portal.openmind.org/).

You can update the model name as per your preference. Get the list of supported models from [here](../../developing/5_llms)
